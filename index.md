## Reading Order

Start here and work through in order — each file builds on concepts from the previous ones.

| # | File | What You'll Learn |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Getting Started & Daily Controls](cli-basics.md) | CLI vs VS Code extension, slash commands, keyboard shortcuts, session lifecycle — start here |
| 2 | [Session & Context Mechanics](session-summary.md) | How sessions work, what fills the context window, what's stateless vs persistent |
| 3 | [Permissions & Interaction Modes](permissions-and-modes.md) | Ask vs Auto-accept vs Plan mode — choose how closely to supervise |
| 4 | [Memory & Instruction Files](memory-and-instructions.md) | CLAUDE.md files, auto memory, session memory — persistent instructions across sessions |
| 5 | [Writing Effective CLAUDE.md Files](writing-effective-claude-md.md) | How to write instructions that actually improve Claude's behavior — concise, actionable, specific |
| 6 | [Tools Reference](tools-reference.md) | Complete list of all 39 tools, grouped by category, with context cost estimates |
| 7 | [How to Trigger Tools](tools-how-to-trigger.md) | What to say (implicitly or explicitly) to make Claude use specific tools |
| 8 | [Prompt Crafting](prompt-crafting.md) | How to write prompts that get the right result on the first try — patterns, scoping, iteration |
| 9 | [Context Management Strategies](context-management.md) | Practical strategies for keeping sessions productive — selective reading, subagents, compaction |
| 10 | [Cost Awareness & Model Selection](cost-and-models.md) | Token costs, Opus vs Sonnet vs Haiku, optimization strategies, when to switch models |
| 11 | [Subagents Deep Dive](subagents.md) | How the Task tool works — agent types, parallelism, background execution, resuming |
| 12 | [MCP Server Configuration](mcp-setup.md) | How to add, configure, and manage MCP servers for additional tools |
| 13 | [Custom Agents](custom-agents.md) | Reusable session personas — what they are, how they differ from subagents, when to use them |
